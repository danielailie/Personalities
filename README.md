# Personalities
Write a small application that reads a list of personalities from a csv file 
(Firstname, Lastname, dob, dod) and stores the information in .objects.
The application should filter out duplicated entries and output the list of objects to the console in a human readable manner:
"Firstname Lastname (dob-dod)". [2 points]
